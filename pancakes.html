  <ol>
   <li>In a large bowl mix the flour with the salt for savoury pancakes or the sugar for sweet pancakes.</li>
   <li>Make a well in the centre of the flour mix and add the egg, slowly add the milk well whisking, I prefer a
   thick smooth mix so I stop adding the milk after I get the consitent I want, if you want a thick batter add
   all the milk.</li>
   <li>Heat a medium frying pan or crepe pan, when warm add a small nob of butter and swiss it around the pan.</li>
   <li>Carefully add a ladleful of mixture to the pan swiss the mix around to cover the pan, cover for 1-2 minutes until
   golden brown, then flip the mix over and cover the other side of the pancake until golden brown. Remove from
   the pan and place on a plate while you cook the rest of the pancakes.</li>
