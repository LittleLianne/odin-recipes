  <p><pre>Once you've made yorkshire pudding yourself you will never go back to the shop bought version

   <li>Three eggs</li>
   <li>150ml milk</li>
   <li>150ml plain flour</li>
   <li>1/2 of salt</li>

<h1>Method:</h1>
  <ol>
   <li>To make the mixture first sift the plain flour into a jug, then stir in the salt.</li>

   <li>Pre-heat the oven to the highest setting.</li>

 <h5> Tips: 1. I measure the milk and flour with a 1/2cup. 2.One egg is around 50ml, if you want to make
 a bigger mix add 50ml more flour and 50ml more flour to each addition egg you add.</h5>
