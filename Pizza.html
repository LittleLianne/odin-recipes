  <h1> Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
	 <li>500g strong bread flour</li>
	 <li>7g fast action yeast</li>
	 <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
	 <li>300ml of water(warm is doing the dough in a few hours, cold is using the over night method</li>
	 <li>2 teaspoon of salt</li>
	 <li>Topping of your choose for example:</li>
	 <li>Tomato pizza sauce</li>
	 <li>Cheese</li>
	 <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
	 <li>Ham</li>
	</ul>
  <h2>This recipe makes two pizzas.</h2>
  <h1>Method:</h1>
   <ol>
    <li> Place the flour and salt in a large bowl and mix, stir in the yeast, then make a well in the centre of the flour and add in the olive oil and some of the water,
	mix together(I like to use the end of a wooden spoon or a dough whisk which is different to a normal balloon whisk.) well adding the rest of the water some times
	all the water isn't needed, it depends on the flour when the mix comes together it's ready for kneading.</li>
	<li> When ready to knead even knead by hand for around 10 minutes or using a stand mixer for around five minutes, you want to achieve a smooth and elastic dough,
	if the dough is really sticky add a bit more flour.</li>
	<li>At this stage the dough can be placed in a bowl and covered in cling film, this can now be placed in the fridge overnight or leave somewhere warm until doubled in size,
	this can take an hour or up to a few hours in colder weather.</li>
	<li>If you had placed the dough in the fridge overnight a few hours or if low on time one hour before the second rise place it on the side to come to room temperature.</li>
	<li>Oil two pizza trays.</li>
	<li>Half the dough, working with one piece of dough at a time, place the piece of dough onto the prepared tray and working with your hands shape the dough to the same size as the tray, repeat with the second dough. Press your fingers into the dough to make indentations in the pizza. Cover with oiled cling film and leave to rise in a warm place for 40 minutes.</li>
	<li>Pre-heat the oven to 210 fan.</li>
	<li>After 40 minutes, remove the cling film and use your fingers to make more indentations into the dough, then spread over the tomato pizza sauce if using, leaving a 1cm edge around the edges, scatter over lots of grated cheese, then scatter over mozzarella cheese if using(be careful with the cheese if you use too much it will melt over the sides) and add whatever other topping you would like. </li>
	<li>Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes until golden, when baked allow to cool slightly on a wire rack so that it doesn't sweat underneath.</li>
	<li>Cook and enjoy.</li>
